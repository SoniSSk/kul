That is assigned where once you have shown interest in purchasing those stocks later on, you can make the payments as in when you have money. Employees will not be entitled to any sort of benefit until they make full payment for their locked-in stocks. It&#8217;s after the official delivery of stocks that they receive such kinds of benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process of issuance of employee stock option plan is a lengthy procedure and the Securities Exchange Board of India, company laws and other governing authorities have tried their level best to keep employee welfare at the centre of the policies. Be it a public company or a private company listed or not listed, the option of floating employee stock option plan is fundamental to success for any business organization. With different types of employee stock option plans, it gives options to employees on what they want to invest in and where the interest lies the most. Once they have decided on which employees&#8217; stock option plan they are keener on investing in, they can then finalize their options for the betterment of their future in the company.</p>\n","id":"cG9zdDoxMDM5","author":{"id":"dXNlcjox","name":"ezylegal","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/49098dd32f92b12a2baf46ff2a143063?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}},"title":"All the intricate details involved in the process of issuance of ESOP policy","excerpt":"<p>ESOP working is quite different and sometimes a bit difficult to explain to a layman.

Many companies decide on hiring a consultant instead of appointing a short term specialist for permanent employment. These consultants are supposed to be experts in their area of specialisation and hence these consultancy agreements are the reason why we are able to bind them for the performance of duty on their part. A consultancy agreement can be regarded as a legal document that forces legal performance on the part of any external consultant and jogs down the lane of all the intricate details related to any dispute termination compensation and any sort of secrecy that can be expected from such personnel. Doing this will not only prevent future disputes but will also make sure that they have smooth sailing all throughout their business Journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who are the parties involved in a legal consultant agreement?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, whenever we talk about a consultant agreement, there are only two parties involved, the consultant and the company. It is a detailed description in which every detail read it to their salary compensation and lentil employment detail is discussed. There are sometimes consultancy agreements signed in between three parties where an agency is also involved. The work of these agencies is to provide good consultants for companies and the contract is in between the company and the agent and a different contract in between Consultant and agent. The repercussions in this scenario are different to that of a traditional consultancy agreement in India. We can also regard a good consultancy agreement similar to a service agreement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Things to consider before you sign a consultancy agreement</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It is expected from you that you read each and every detail and take your time before signing that agreement. In case of any doubt, you must clarify it and if you do not agree on certain levels then you must reconsider signing the contract.</li><li>It is expected from you to also consider this document as a Bible for your short business journey. Everything related to your what will be discussed over here hence uses this agreement to define your relationship.</li><li>Go through the confidentiality clause over and over again because that is the area where most of the consultancy agreements are violated by other parties.</li><li>You&#8217;re also advised to seek help from good legal counsel in case you&#8217;re unable to comprehend a clause or something you consider might fall in the grey area. There might be similar issues that can cause disputes in the future hence seeking help from a lawyer in advance might help you in the long run.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What can be some major advantages of framing a good consultancy agreement?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It increases the scope of Confidentiality, there are times when you want to discuss the norms that a person might be needed to comply with and with this contracting parties can express themselves.</li><li>There were times when oral contracts were quite prevalent but a consultancy agreement provides evidence of all the rights and duties that the parties to contact needs to fulfil.</li><li>Consultancy agreement also acts as a guard to the parties. It makes sure all the rights of signatories of consultancy agreements are protected. It further reduces the scope of any future dispute.</li><li>With the help of a good consultancy agreement scope of clarity increases and the nature of work is enhanced. There is a detailed description of each and every clause and this is the reason why people would prefer having a consultancy agreement.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Status of consultancy agreement in India</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier consultancy Agreements were generally created for the clients or their employers but now this practice has been spread widely all across the market. People are using this to create a consultancy partnership agreement, consultancy agreement with companies, consultancy agreement for professional services and many more. The reason why it is spread is that, although we are low on the chain of making futuristic changes in the field of law, the rate of adaptability is quite high.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consultancy services in India have now migrated toward the online medium as well. Services that are offered on an online medium are negotiable instruments, intellectual properties, common tax services, property services and much more. These agreements and contracts are tailored to the needs of the parties and will make sure that there is nothing creating future ambiguity and disputes. The main purpose of creating a constancy agreement is to have a clutter-free life and if that purpose is not fulfilled there is no reason to invest in projects like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned earlier, India is a country that has a lot of scope for development in the field of law. If the right number of people devote themselves to the development of futuristic contracts, the machinery will move towards more law-abiding than law fearing. All the razzmatazz and glitter that the law industry provides to other people from the different fields is all because of such vital developments. So, the future of law is not just with a black gown but with people who have open minds towards accepting new things.</p>\n","id":"cG9zdDoxMDM1","author":{"id":"dXNlcjox","name":"ezylegal","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/49098dd32f92b12a2baf46ff2a143063?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}},"title":"What Everyone Ought To Know About Consultancy Agreements in India","excerpt":"<p>Contractual agreements are the reason why legal enforceability becomes easy and grounds to bring such actionable claims gain some footing.

It is usually considered as a bilateral agreement where there is a legal obligation to offer services from one end and payment for services from the other. The relationship between employer and employee has always been a hot topic of discussion and with time it has evolved because of the ever-evolving nature of employment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kinds of employment contract</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we study types of employment contracts they can be broadly classified under three heads and they include:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fixed-term contract</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the name suggests it&#8217;s a contract which has got a set period and is usually for the period less than four years. If the term of the contract exceeds the tenure of four years it is considered as permanent employment rather than fixed-term employment. The reason why people offer fixed-term employment is that it gives employment security and all the benefits that are permanent employment contract might provide them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many nuances that people need to consider before drafting a fixed-term employment contract. In the case where the employment documents suggest any employee working for a tenure of three years but he or she continues to work over the set period and no one raises an objection. In such a situation it is considered that there has been an implied extension agreement created between employer and employee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Permanent employment contract</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In most situations, if it wasn&#8217;t assigning an employment agreement it is considered as a permanent employment contract because it is the most prevalent and used mode of offering employment all across the nation. Employment contract in India is heavily dependent upon this type of employment because it is a driving force of our economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under this head, employment is considered to be ongoing until it is expressed to be terminated either from the employers and all employees. Under this head, a permanent employment contract can cover full-time employment or part-time employment. Usually, all kinds of statutory benefits and rights are provided to employees of this contract.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Casual employment contracts or freelancer’s contract</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The name is quite suggestive of the fact that this kind of contract is ended only in the situation or scenarios where services are needed for a particular work or hours. These kinds of employment can be offered on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. The pattern of work in this kind of employment is usually dependent upon the employee rather than the employer. Payments in such kinds of employment are usually heavily dependent upon the kind of services the employee has rendered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we talk about benefits and extra perks that other kinds of employment contracts enjoy, there isn&#8217;t much that is delivered in this kind of employment agreement. There is no requirement of employment contract bond or employment contract notice since it is an hourly basis task.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Major heads that are covered under an employment contract in India</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compensation details: this contains all the details of benefits offered by the company to its employees after they deliver their services for us for some time. It contains all the salary breakdown, medical insurance, sick leaves and vacations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Designation</strong>: under this head company tries to specify what kind of position they are intending to offer to their employee. Usually, matches will do this are discussed before offering the employment letter and this is a formal mention of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Duration of employment</strong>: fixed-term employment contract, where there is a need of providing all the details later to the duration of employment, are specified not this head. There is no need of specifying the duration of employment in cases of permanent employment where generally there is no cap on duration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Termination</strong>: Clauses that are related to the termination of employment to default in services or noncompliance with the orders given by the employer or in some cases employee tries to abandon the contract, all the nuances related to these issues are mentioned under this head. Employment authorization documents or any other documents that are needed to be presented while seeking admissions, in case of their absence contracts are also terminated you do unable to meet the eligibility criteria of that organisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Confidentiality clauses</strong>: there are times when you are under an employment contract, some kind of secrecy and confidentiality is expected out of your post-op if you feel under living that then there might be some serious actions that can be taken against you. All the repercussions related to breach of confidentiality and information that needs to stay undisclosed is discussed under this head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employment contract in India is like any other contract. The journey which has covered the modern industrial era has been immense. There were times where people were not on board with the fact of getting their employment contract duly written and signed to coming on to the times where employment contracts are being offered and signed on E contract basis is a huge journey covered under one generation. The presence of employment contracts is the reason why all the interests of employees and employers are protected and it also makes sure all the terms and conditions are followed on a long term basis.</p>\n","id":"cG9zdDo5ODk=","author":{"id":"dXNlcjox","name":"ezylegal","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/49098dd32f92b12a2baf46ff2a143063?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}},"title":"What everyone must know about Employment Contracts in India","excerpt":"<p>An employment contract in India is like any other contract where you have offer, acceptance, legal objects, free consent, consideration and competent parties.

In that employment contract, all the important details related to your Place of work, hours of work, holiday entitlement, sickness absence, notice period, pension arrangement, grievance procedures and collective agreements are mentioned. The employment contract aims to make sure there aren&#8217;t many future disputes arising due to default in commitments from the employee. However, much you try to minimise problems that might lead to future disputes, there will be many opportunities where you will have to seek legal help from expert sources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Important covenants added in any employment contract</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Non-disclosure of confidential information</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an important clause mentioned in every employment contract that the person who shall be appointed as an employee in a specific organisation will make sure that all the organization information would be kept confidential and not disclosed to any person or organisation outside. Any breach or disclosure of information might cause termination and legal repercussions in the future. It is important to make this call clear else there are a few chances of disputes arising in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of <em>Diljeet Titus Vs Mr Alfred A. Adebare</em> and others, it was noted that information taken away illegally from any organisation shall be punishable by the court of law. The court also restrained the defendant from continuing this practice in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Non-solicitation by employees</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the most important clauses that is added to any employment contract. Under this, an employer suggests that if any employee or an ex-employee tries to indulge in unfair trade practises or works against the interest of the company and its customer shall be condemned and will be treated with severity. In the case of <em>Desiccant Rotor&#8217;s International Private Limited Vs Sircar and Others</em>, it was noted that the manager was found soliciting some desiccants customers and suppliers and he was prohibited and penalised accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Non-competition clause</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under this clause, it is agreed that the employee signing this contract shall not enter into similar trade or profession in the future which might generate competition against the employer. This might seem a simple straight statement, but the legality of this clause is questioned under section 272 of the contract act 1872, this might be considered as a restraint of trade which can be held as voidable under law. Despite its legal standing not very clear, employers mention this clause in the employment agreement. Employment contract terms and conditions are very important and can only be subjected to people during the employee’s employment tenure; except non-solicitation which can continue even after the employee exits</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reasons why we need a written employment contract</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier there were times when people were not particular about every little detail regarding official hiring. It is now one of the major requirements by any firm or company to have a written employment contract as it helps in avoiding any misunderstandings and disputes in the future. All the fine details which are important to contract are written down and this can help in proving one of the legal positions in any matter of dispute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;It also helps in managing the expectations of employees and employers at certain levels. This also helps in managing responsibilities and entitlements at different levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ways of making alterations in an employment contract</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are seeking any minor changes to an employee’s contract, one must give a notice in advance and after that put them in writing. Once you present these clauses in front of your employer, if both parties mutually agree to a point, then a modified new contract can be created.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Different stages in which employment contract disputes can arise</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Pre hiring stage</li><li>Termination stage</li><li>During employment</li><li>Post-termination</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Employment contract in India has advanced a great deal with industrial modifications and increase in the number of white-collar employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Modes in which employment contract agreement disputes can be resolved</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Filing a written complaint to the HR and/or Head of Business</li><li>Internal grievance procedure</li><li>With the help of claiming constructive unfair dismissal with courts that are specially designed for this kind of issue (For instance Employment tribunal)</li><li>Using the process of negotiation with the employer</li><li>Settlement agreement</li><li>Filing a complaint for unlawful deduction in the wages with the Labour Inspector</li><li>One can also argue for discrimination in the employment tribunal</li><li>Going to the high authorities such as Supreme Court a High Court for the breach of contract</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employment contracts have come a long way. The inclusion of anticompetitive or anti-solicitation clauses in current agreements is quite suggestive of the fact that the employers are protective about their business and want their employees to strictly adhere to ethical practice while working in the organisation. With help of a tightly knit employment contract, one can avoid future disputes and can work on future terms and conditions.

In case of gift, the person transferring the property is known as the donor and the person accepting the gift is known as the done. The gift to be legally valid must be accepted by or on behalf of the done during the lifetime of the donor and while he is still capable of giving. The essential elements of a valid gift are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>There must be a transfer of ownership</li><li>Transfer should be made of an Existing property</li><li>Transfer should be made without consideration</li><li>The donor transfers the property voluntarily with free consent</li><li>The gift must be accepted by the done during the lifetime of the donor</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Modes of making gift</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the nature of the property to be transferred, the law prescribes two modes for effecting a gift.&nbsp; In case of transfer of immovable property by way of gift, registration is necessary irrespective of the value of the property, that means a gift deed is prepared in which the details of the transaction are documented which is signed by the donor and attested by two competent witnesses and duly stamped and registered.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In case of transfer of movable property, it can be transferred by the delivery of possession, that means the gift is complete once the subject matter of gift is handed over to the donee.

It should be mentioned that there is no exchange of money or any other type of consideration involved. It should be clearly mentioned that the transfer of property is being made out of love and affection.&nbsp;</li><li>The gift deed should clearly mention that the transfer is voluntary and the transferor has a very clear intention making the transfer of the property</li><li>A clause specifying the rights of Donee must be included.&nbsp;</li><li>The details of the delivery of possession whether it would be expressed or implied, must also be mentioned</li><li>To be cautious, it is advisable to include a revocation clause in the gift deed to avoid any kind of future issues/litigation complications</li><li>Two witnesses and their signatures to be affixed in the gift deed</li><li>The gift deed must be printed on stamp paper after paying the required amount which would be calculated based on the valuation of the property</li><li>Lastly the deed should be registered at the registrar or sub-registrar’s office</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Documents required for gift deed registration</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For transfer of a property through gift deed, the following documents are required at the time of registration:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Aadhar Card of the parties</li><li>Id Proofs, like PAN, Driver License, Passport, etc;</li><li>PAN card of both the parties&nbsp;</li><li>Original Gift Deed&nbsp;</li><li>Sale deed or other original document to prove the title of the donor to the Property</li><li>The Encumbrance Certificate, if any</li><li>Any other agreements pertaining to the property</li><li>Other documents/materials as may be required as per the requirements of the law of the place of registration</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stamp Duty payable for registering a gift deed</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stamp duty has to be paid for registering the gift deed.

Situations in which the problem of custody arises is generally in places of divorce and there are proper child custody lawyers who are assigned to undertake this job. Thus keeping in mind the physical, healthcare, medical and lifestyle development of a child, custody for the child is offered to that parent who is deemed to be fit for that particular job and can meet the needs to end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When is child custody awarded?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, the matters of child custody arise only when a couple is getting divorced and it is the separating couple who can claim the custody of their child. There are many cases when either of the parents is unable to take custody of the child due to some of the legal obligations. In such a situation either the grandparents from the maternal or paternal side can claim the custody of the day grandchild. It is still all up to the decision making off the family court. if they feel there is enough reason to award that custody to the grandparents or some relative, They will do it taking proper caution and care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Factors that determine the welfare of a child?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Family court has a big task of determining if the parent or the person seeking custody is the best suitable option for nurturing the Childs future. These are some major parameters under which the questions regarding the welfare of a child are decided:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Taking into consideration if proper education will be provided to the kid.</li><li>To see if a proper safe and nurturing environment is available for the developmental growth of the child’s capabilities.</li><li>Ethical upbringing also plays a very vital role in reckoning whether child welfare is taken into consideration or not.</li><li>Financial stability is the last parameter that is considered while deciding on granting child custody after divorce.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are some of the major forms of child custody?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indian legal system recognises four major forms of child custody and they are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Physical custody</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the most common and sorted ways of granting custody. Here one of the parents is granted full guardianship of the child and the other parent can take some time to time visits decided by the court. This is one of the major ways in which people can a certain if the child is getting the love and attention of both of his or her parents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joint custody:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this situation, as the name suggests, custody is allowed to both of the parents from time to time. Joint custody Believe in the phenomena of not sharing marital ties but being able to take proper care of their kids with equal sharing hours. This can be regarded as one of the best solutions to nodular Child&#8217;s future and make sure they are not devoid of their parents love and attention. This proper arrangement that the family court decides on and both of the parents have to agree on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third-party custody:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The need for such kind of custody arises when the family court is under the impression neither of the parents is capable of raising their kids in a very fruitful manner. The other decide on giving the custody to their grandparents or some of the relatives who have the proper amenities and love for that child.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sole custody:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under this type of custody, all the rights are reserved to one of the biological parents and other parents cannot visit their child. The reason why this custody is taken into consideration is that either of their parents has a history of being an abusive parent and being around such kind of environment can hamper the growth of the child. Under this type of custody no right whatsoever is awarded to the parent who is not granted sole custody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to win child custody for mothers in India?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we take presidents into consideration, we will see that historically child custody has been awarded more to mothers than fathers. So, if you are preparing all your documents for seeking child custody then the chances of getting child custody are equal to that of a father. What you need to make sure is that all the documents and evidence that you have collected are on point. Make sure you highlight that you have the best interest of your child and his or her future. So the answer to the question of how to win child custody for mothers in India is the same as to how to win child custody for fathers in India because Indian laws are gender neutral and they only see with the eyes of law and documents presented right in front of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Child custody in India is heavily dependent upon personal laws and the kind of documents and evidence you present in front of them. The guardians and wards act 1890 is the governing London that makes sure who will get the divorce child custody. The court will always prefer granting custody to their parents instead of a third party because child welfare is kept at the centre of reckoning who will get the custody of the child after a divorce.<br><br></p>\n","id":"cG9zdDo4NDU=","author":{"id":"dXNlcjox","name":"ezylegal","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/49098dd32f92b12a2baf46ff2a143063?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}},"title":"A guide to everything about child custody in India","excerpt":"<p>We&#8217;ve often seen that many movies take this matter of child custody as the centre of their storyline and use it in showing how parents separating becomes a burning issue for a child.

Some marriages end peacefully with mutual understanding and some with a chaotic mess. But no matter how it ends, it is the child who suffers the most. Caught in this tug of war of custody battles between both the parents and endless arguments with child custody lawyers, the child ends up feeling mentally stressed and out of place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Indian Law takes this into account and weighs in more towards the benefit of the child. The age-old perception that the mother is the natural guardian of the child is now invalid as the laws have changed over the years. More importance is now given to the welfare of the child rather than which parent has been able to put up a stronger fight. Child custody is not the ‘right of the parent’ anymore. It is, however, a ‘right of the child.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The parent who can keep the child safe and best attend to the child’s emotional, educational, and medical needs has a higher chance to gain custody of the child.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Which parent can apply for child custody?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both the parents have the right to apply for the custody of the child. However, who finally gets it is a decision that is in the court’s hands. The Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 gives complete power to the court to decide the most suitable guardian for the child.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to remember that the earning capacity of a parent is not the deciding factor when it comes to handing out the custody of a child. The court carefully analyses the capacity of a parent to provide a safe and secure environment for a child. A non-earning mother may not be entirely barred from custody if she can provide a better environment for raising the child. This is compensated by asking the earning father to provide child support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How is the custody of a minor decided?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Supreme Court has always emphasized that irrespective of the arguments put forward by the parents it is ultimately the welfare of the child that is given the most significance when deciding custody. The mother is given preference when deciding the custody of a child who is less than five years old. But that doesn’t mean that once the child has attained a particular age the father gets undisputed rights either. The child’s opinion is taken into account when the court makes decisions about these issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the custody of a child is given to a parent the court takes care that the other parent is not prohibited from keeping in touch with the child. The Indian Law ensures that the child receives the care and attention of both parents. The other parent is given the visitations rights, the conditions for which are decided by the court.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Types of Child Custody in India</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three main types of child custody:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Legal Custody</li><li>Physical Custody</li><li>Joint Custody</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Legal Custody</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Legal custody of a child means the right to make decisions about the child’s upbringing and well-being. The parent who has legal custody has the right to make all the decisions from where the child will study to the doctor who will treat the child. It does not necessarily mean that the child will live with the legal custodian but the decisions for the child will be made by them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Legal custody is usually given to both parents where they have the right to share the responsibility among themselves and to make mutual decisions until the child has reached the age of 18. In messy divorce cases, situations may arise where only one parent is given the right to make all these important decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Physical Custody</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giving physical custody of a child to a parent means the child will live with them under their guardianship and the other parent will be allotted periodic visits. This is done to ensure that the child is brought up in a safe and fulfilling environment but receives affection from both parents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Joint Custody</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joint custody is where the child lives with both the parents alternately according to the timetable allotted by the court. The duration of stay may vary between days, weeks, or months. This helps the child get the affection of both parents while the parents may also consider themselves playing an active part in the child’s life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who are eligible for child custody?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both the parents have the right to gain primary custody of the child. But in circumstances where either of the two is not in a position to claim the right, due to death or any other law that prohibits them, then any relatives can seek the right to custody. In some cases, the court may appoint a third person as the guardian of the child. In India, child custody is governed by the Guardian and Wards Act, 1890 which has been made by giving utmost importance to the welfare of the child above anything else. The opinion of the child matters just as much as all the other factors while making decisions and the court is the final deciding entity in this. Though the Guardian and Wards Act, 1890 is the universal law involving child custody, under some secular principles, laws of different religions are also considered.</p>\n","id":"cG9zdDo4NDA=","author":{"id":"dXNlcjox","name":"ezylegal","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/49098dd32f92b12a2baf46ff2a143063?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}},"title":"What you should know about the child custody laws in India","excerpt":"<p>Inevitable circumstances cause some marriages to break and force couples to part ways from each other.
